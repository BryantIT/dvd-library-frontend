## Project Name & Pitch

Personal Media Library

A project to organize a users personal collection of dvds, digital movies and books for the purpose of referencing what you have vs what you don't have.

## Project Status

This is an ongoing personal project originally built as a final project submission for Flatiron school. Project requirements completed but there are still some functionality I will add to practice and continue to learn.

## Additional features I plan to add
(I will update this list as I complete each one as well as if I think of more)

* Search Function
* User submitted images
* Tags (such as location; home, loaned to friend, digital or hard copy)
* Stretch goal: I would like to eventually set this up so that a user just has to enter a title and that will pull an   image and further information from an external API while still saving everything to the database.
* Stretch Stretch goal: A user just has to scan the barcode on the back of a dvd or book to get all information saved to the database

## Reflection

This was the final project for my time at Flatiron School. Project goals included using everything I had learned so far, use create-react-app and a rails backend.  

When I first started at Flatiron the very first thing I wanted to build was some way to organize my own personal dvd collection so that I could just look up my library on my phone from anywhere I am.  I have this problem that I have so many dvds that when I see a movie on sale somewhere I sometimes forget if I already own that movie. In the beginning of my time at Flatiron I didn't have the skill and knowledge to create the app I wanted. When I finally got to the last module and learned about React and Redux I realized I could finally build the app I wanted.  

One of the main challenges I ran into was Redux as a whole.  The problem I had wasn't really technical.  It was wrapping my mind around why this was even needed.  The problem was that I had practice using Redux on very small projects and it was very much overkill.  It wasn't until I was halfway through a much larger project (this one), that I started to see the benefits of Redux

At the end of the day, the technologies implemented in this project are React, React-Router, Redux, React-Sass and a significant amount of VanillaJS, JSX, and CSS. I chose to use the `create-react-app` boilerplate to minimize initial setup.
